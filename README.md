Paging has various flags, bring to 96 bytes. currently just using page id
need to use dirty flag now that flush is done

make an error module with a big enum in it and use that everywhere so that it has all types.

lru cache uses a free list that owns DLLNodes, which own the page objects. There's a trash vector too.
it stores indices of deleted nodes in the old vector.
am i checking if the node id is in trash during search? no. do i need to? idk. prolly not on just 1 thread.
dll nodes store indices in the nodes vector. addition of nodes first checks if trash is empty.

popping a node from the dll flushes it but this should be done only if it is dirty. haven't added dirty
flag usage yet even though page header includes it.

buffer pool hides APIs for page stuff so that other components need only worry about getting the page and
not whether it is from RAM or ROM. it caches it right after. there's get mut and regular get. that's because
of rust's ownership mechanism, which has been a bit of a nuisance so far for a single threaded project.

db file modified only on flush and allocate so far. page deletion not added. otherwise, it's a buffer of 
[u8;PAGE_SIZE] that is modified. it is all little endian bytes. slots and the header have a serialize method
in their impl too to abstract all the byte management away. Just make an array using to_le_bytes() and then
do copy_from_slice at the needed offset in the buffer from the bytes array.

each record is fixes size : 128 bytes at max size. That doesn't mean each user entry must be 128 bytes.
just that putting 128 bytes solves external fragmentation but usually guarantees internal fragmentation.
each slot is 6 bytes. record id, offset and size. this is where the actual user entered data size is stored.

B+ tree

AAAAH. between m/2 and m values per node. each node has next too, forms a linked list. this prevents going back
and speeds up traversal.

- Corruption tests
- Error handling
